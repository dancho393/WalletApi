   7. Access the API Documentation
      Once the application is running, open your browser and go to:
      http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
   
      Here, you can test the available API endpoints.
      
      Important:
   
       First, register using the Register endpoint.
       After successful registration, log in with the same profile using the Login endpoint.
       Copy the JWT token from the login response.
       Paste the token into the Authorize field in the Swagger UI.
   
      Note: The waller endpoints require authentication because Spring Security is enabled.
